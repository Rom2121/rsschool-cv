#### About Myself:

I am a student at the University of Gdansk majoring in genetics and experimental biology. I was drawn to biology since school, and the topic of the human code was especially exciting.
I was not particularly interested in the IT sphere and only knew that it could provide a good income, ahah.
But of course, we had classes on bioinf, where we were shown a lot of tools for studying the gene code just on a PC. From that moment, the idea matured to figure out how it all works.
And here I am sitting here and have been struggling with the initial tasks for several days....T-T

Oh and by the way, I work in a warehouse (a hint of some logistics skills)
